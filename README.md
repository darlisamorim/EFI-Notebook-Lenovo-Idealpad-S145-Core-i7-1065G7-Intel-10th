- After updating the BIOS to version (DKCN53WW) and making its settings, I also modified the BIOS internally to avoid Kernel Panics!


**IMPORTANT ALERTS:**

**Observation: Carefully read the above content, because if you carefully follow everything I've done, you'll be able to use macOS without problems on your notebook, but always take into account the Hardware and Software changes I've made.

However, even with these changes made by me, it is entirely possible to adapt these EFI to your Notebook as long as it has the same Hardware version mentioned above in (Laptop Factory Defaults), it is only necessary to update and configure for the BIOS version (DKCN53WW).

I will leave just one more important detail, I removed my serials from the EFI's so it is necessary to generate new serials and add them to the config.plist file.
Use [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) to generate the serials, in order to make your life easier the place to add the serials is config.plist>PlatformInfo>Generic; and I marked the values that needed to be replaced with XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, just replace with the serials that you will generate in GenSMBIOS

To modify the config.plist file I use [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree).
